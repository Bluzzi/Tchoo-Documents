# We are excited to announce our new project

## Presentation
The Tchoos is a play to earn pet caring game and an NFT collection of **5000 unique 3D Aliens**. 
In this Mini-Metaverse you will have to take care of your own Alien through different tasks like washing, feeding or petting.

The Tchoos are super cute aliens living on the Elrond blockchain, represented as NFT these companions are waiting to be adopted and raised with love.

Each Tchoo is unique, their own characteristics as adorable as each other.

Our collection is different than the other, with our mobile application you can interact and take care of your own Tchoo displayed in 3d, obviously the more you take care of it the more rewards you receive.

## Rewards Explication
These rewards are in the form of points and there are two types of points: prestige points and lottery points.

Prestige points allow you to compete with other trainers by showing that YOU are the most caring, they are obtained when you take care of your Tchoo.

The lottery points are obtained periodically and allow you to try your luck in the lottery to win material and immaterial prizes.

## Mint Process
As a way to reward our early tchoos owner, we will release the collection by wave with an ascending price for each wave. There will be 5 waves of 1000 Tchoos with the first wave having a cost per NFT of 1 EGLD.
