## Concept
An application where we can get virtual pets under the form of an NFT. There will be different rarities for each pet (see rarity and selling waves)

We can take care of the pet with different ways :
- Wash him
- Feed him
- Getting him to sleep
- Pet him
- ...

Taking good care of the pet will increase his "hapiness bar", which will allow to get more "x point"

## Rarity and selling waves
> - if : 10 differents pet, 15 textures, 15 accesories => 11250 possibilities
> - if : 10 differents pet, 10 textures, 10 accesories => 5000 possibilities

> - once we have 3D models the NFT creation will be automatized
- 1 :
    - 10 pets (6 classic, 3 rares, 1 ultra rare)
    - each pet will have 10 / 15 different textures (different colors), with different rarities (golden pet..)
    - 15 differents accesories (hat, scarf...)
- 2 :
    - ...
    - ...
- 3 :
    - ...
    - ... 
- 4 :
    - ...
    - ...
- 5 :
    - ...
    - ...

## Prices :
- Each common NFT will be sold for 1 EGLD ($240) (it may change, we dont really know)

## What we need :
- Logo Meta Friend and logo The Tchoos
- Pets and accesories will be created in 3D, the models have to be exported in a OBJ format
- ...

## X points
- allows to buy lottery tickets to win IRL prizes
- earned every 5 minutes (10 points) and have an hapiness bar maxed give a buff of 200% to base earned points (30 instead of 10 (potential values) )
- pet rarity give a buff (+0% for classic pets, +50% to rare pets, +100% to ultra rares pet (potential values) )
